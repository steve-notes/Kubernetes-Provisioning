<p>
This script I made is for my own purpose, so I can save time and be more efficient when I need to install a Kubernetes cluster.
For now, this script only supports provisioning Kubernetes V1.29 and is supported only on Ubuntu 
server (tested on Ubuntu 22.04).

So, if you want to try installing the same Kubernetes version and use an Ubuntu server, feel free to use it. :metal:
